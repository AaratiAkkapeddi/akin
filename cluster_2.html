            <h1>Children posing with an object for support, usually a side table with flowers.</h1><p>Composite of 14 photographs, 11 of them from the stars.archive and 3 from the artist’s family albums. Images include those from R. Dasen Studio in Coimbatore, Sundram Studio in Karaikudi, Victoria Studio in Madurai, Naidu & Sons Studio in Nagapattinam, Navakodi Studio in Thanjavur and Newtone Studio in Thoothukudi and others from unidentified sources.<br><br>“This archetype is actually not unique to Tamil photography. It points to longer exposure times where accessories, such as furniture, became a way to stabilize the subject. The objects themselves are interesting in that some in this cluster use ‘neoclassical’ backdrops such as pillars or carved wooden tables, but some are மோடா, a type of stool made from bamboo, or other rattan furniture.”</p>
