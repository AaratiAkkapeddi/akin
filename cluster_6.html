           <h1>Women posing with a mirror to show off their elaborate hair braiding and flowers.</h1><p>Composite of 5 photographs, all from the stars.archive. Images made in New Studio in Madurai, Sri Devi Studio in Pattukkottai and Chitra Studio in Villupuram are featured with others from unidentified sources.<br><br>“My mother was too young in many of the studio photographs to remember the experience. But she did recall having flowers stitched into her hair before having a photo taken with her cousins. I was particularly intrigued by images in the stars.archive where a mirror was used to also show the back view of the women's hair in the portrait.”</p>
