This looks like it was taken before he left to work in Geneva, Switzerland for the first time in the early 1970's. So it could be an ID photograph for travel or just for family members to remember him before making the trip. Alternatively, it could also be an ID photo for entering the IIT campus where he was a professor and where my mother grew up.</p>",

I believe this photograph was taken before he left to the United States the first time around 1952 (all the way to Oklahoma). Zoé Headley, founder and researcher at stars.archive mentioned that this image was probably 'pink-washed', a photo-manipulation technique used to smooth the skin. </p>",

I don't know when this was taken, but I do know that my great-uncle spent some time in the United States so perhaps this was an ID photograph for travel. However, he is smiling and so it could also just be a formal portrait. </p>",
