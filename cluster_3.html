            <h1>Standing portrait of a couple where the woman is on the left-hand side of the photograph.</h1><p>Composite of 13 photographs, twelve of them from the stars.archive and the remaining one from the artist’s family albums. Images from the Prince Studio in Coimbatore, Tamilnadu Studio in Madurai, Navajeeven Studio and Viajaya barathi Studio in Theni, and Chitra Studio in Viluppuram are featured with others from unidentified sources.<br><br>“In my own family album, photographs of weddings or of couples shortly after marriage are probably the most common archetype. It makes me think of the cultural and financial significance placed on marriage. In the stars.archive I noticed many images of what appear to be portraits of married couples. I'm also interested in whether the wife stands on the husband's left or right. Anecdotally, my grandmother mentioned to me that in Tamil, “இடம் means left. இடம் also means place. So, if you give இடம் to your wife, she will take your place."  Although, despite this, I did see a few photographs with wives standing to the left of their husbands.”</p>
